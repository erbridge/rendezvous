# Rendezvous

This is a game originally made for Ludum Dare 34 with Maike Vierkant. The theme was **Growing**.


## Install

Play [online](http://erbridge.co.uk/rendezvous/).


## Develop

Since the site is hosted on GitHub Pages (hence `gh-pages` being the main branch), I use Jekyll when developing it. Any webserver would do, however.


### Install

```
$ bundle install --path="./bundle"
```


### Run

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```
